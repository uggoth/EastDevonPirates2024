ZyderBot is a four-wheel drive tractor with tank steering
main chassis: 3D printed
stereo cameras with depth perception
brushless motors with pulse feedback for accurate motion
bespoke 3d printed wheels for total flexibility
Raspberry Pi 3B
Raspberry Pi Picos for time-critical operations
replaceable 18650 li-ion batteries for better power density than NiMh and better safety than LiPo
each modular interchangeable attachment will have a specific design for servos and 
a plug-in connection to tthe chassis for power and control

Colin: I have made a lot of demonstration / educational robots to try to interest young 
people in the activity. They range from simple Pico-controlled tabletop
Lego-compatible robots that just drive around without falling off, to
PANDA, which uses Canny edge-detect to find a bomb and drop it over the edge.

John: Finding myself retired, but not yet finished, I want to encourage all 
ages to get involved and embrace modern computing and robotics through having fun?

Paula: ????

Ian:  I've made simple robots for with young people but never anything this complex.


Colin: I have always enjoyed messing about with robots, and found Pi Wars 2022 a real challenge. 
For PiWars 2024 I will use my experience to do better.
John: New to robotics, actively looking at developing open source solutions 
in assisted living for wheelchair users?
Ian:  As well as having a lot of fun, I hope to learn more about robotics 
that I can include in both fuure events like the Sidmouth Science Festival 
as well as my youth work.

Challenges run autonomously + remote control + blogging
