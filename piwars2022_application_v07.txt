ZyderBot will be a four-wheel drive tractor with tank steering
Stereo cameras with depth perception providing vision feedback for SLAM
Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS
Main code in Python, subsidiary code in MicroPython (or just possibly C++)
Raspberry Pi Picos (or just possibly Arduinos) for time-critical operations
Each modular interchangeable attachment will have a specific design for servos and 
a plug-in connection to the chassis for power and control
Remote control will be done using SBUS and Pico
At the end of the project all code on GitHub and all 3D models on Thingiverse will be made public
For more details see attached design notes
The project style will be Form Follows Function. We aim to do the tasks in the time
and just channel the agricultural vibe.

Colin: I have made a lot of demonstration / educational robots to try to interest young 
people in the activity. They range from simple Pico-controlled tabletop
Lego-compatible robots that just drive around without falling off, to
PANDA, which uses Canny edge-detect to find a bomb and drop it over the edge.

John: Finding myself retired, but not yet finished, I want to encourage all 
ages to get involved and embrace modern computing and robotics through having fun?

Paul: I am a Systems Engineer since 1970, with real robots still operating 
since 1985 and an expectation for continued operation until decommissioning 
in 2030. My main focus has always been High Integrity Systems.
I am a STEM Ambassador who tries to enthuse the younger minds to take up 
STEM careers or challenges for the betterment of humanity.

Ian:  I've made simple robots for use with young people but never anything this complex.


Colin: I have enjoyed messing about with robots, but want more of a challenge. 
For PiWars I will have to try new things and make them work with a deadline.
Performance-critical robots will be an exciting new field.
John: New to robotics, actively looking at developing open source solutions 
in assisted living for wheelchair users?
Paul: Forth specialist, working on a Pi based robot for primary schools.
Ian:  As well as having a lot of fun, I hope to learn more about robotics 
that I can include in both fuure events like the Sidmouth Science Festival 
as well as my youth work.

Challenges run autonomously + remote control + blogging

Colin: No
John: No
Paul: No
Ian:  No

Having previously given one-off demonstrations we would like to involve the local schools
in an ongoing activity. We want to
use Pi Wars as a vehicle to reach out to the schools, 
giving us a concrete example of a live project. 
Our website (https://eastdevonpirates.org) and blog (https://eastdevonpirates.blogspot.com/)
will help with this as well as visits and presentations.
